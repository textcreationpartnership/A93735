            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The <hi>CASE</hi> of <hi>Richard Stafford</hi> humbly offered to the Con≈øideration of both Hou≈øes of Parliament.</head>
            <p>WHereas <hi>Richard Stafford</hi> hath been, and ≈øtands yet indicted at Common Law, and hath ≈øuffered a Weeks Impri≈øonment in <hi>Newgate</hi> for certain Papers, entituled, <hi>A Supplemental Tract of Government,</hi> &amp;c. which he delivered in to the late Parliament on <hi>January</hi> 4. 1689. to which he made an Appearance at the la≈øt Se≈ø≈øions at the <hi>Old-Bayley,</hi> and had Oyer of his Indictment, which did run in the≈øe words, <hi>viz. That the ≈øaid</hi> Richard Stafford <hi>did intend to rai≈øe difference and di≈øcord between the King and Queen, and their Peers and Great Men, and the Commons of this Kingdom of</hi> England <hi>in Parliament lately a≈ø≈øembled,</hi> &amp;c. He the ≈øaid <hi>Richard Stafford</hi> did offer to this by way of An≈øwer and Plea, That what he did was in <hi>full Parliament,</hi> and that he was introduced according to Form and Order into the Hou≈øe of Lords, the Hou≈øe then ≈øitting; and the Sub≈øtance and Matter of the ≈øaid Paper, was referred to the Con≈øideration of the Lords and Commons; And if it did tend <hi>to breed difference and di≈øcord between the King and Queen and</hi> Them, Them≈øelves were the more proper Judges of what lay in their own brea≈øt, and whereof a Jury of 12 inferiour Men were not ≈øo fit to judge and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. And further it was alledged, That this Ca≈øe did come within the rea≈øon of Stat. 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Gulielmi &amp; Mariae,</hi> for declaring the Rights and Liberties of the Subject, and ≈øetling the Succe≈ø≈øion of the Crown; wherein among≈øt the ≈øeveral in≈øtances of mal-admini≈øtration of the late Reign there recited, one was, <hi>By Pro≈øecutions in the Court of the Kings-Bench for Matters and Cau≈øes cognizable only in Parliament:</hi> And it was a like Error there to proceed in a more inferiour Court for what belongs to their Conu≈øance. Though this Clau≈øe was in≈øerted in as to the Ca≈øe of Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> who was illegally proceeded again≈øt in the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> for what he did as Speaker in the Hou≈øe of <hi>Commons;</hi> yet no publick Statute expre≈ø≈øed in general words, is made to reach only one ≈øingle and particular Ca≈øe, but it takes in all others of the like Nature and Rea≈øon. It is agreeable both to the Statute and Common Laws of this Kingdom, and to right Practice and U≈øage, That things ≈øhould be heard where they are done: And that great and weighty matters (whereof the pre≈øent, according to the Indictment, is the greate≈øt that can be, and may be ≈øtiled a Ca≈øe of many Generations) ≈øhould be determined in the highe≈øt Courts of Judicatory. The rea≈øon why ≈øome things of this nature have been tryed at Common Law, is becau≈øe ≈øometimes of the long interval and ≈øpace of time between Parliaments, (and with this, if I mi≈øtake not, they did palliate the proceedings again≈øt Mr. <hi>Williams)</hi> and ≈øo the Offender might e≈øcape Ju≈øtice in the mean while, which would be a great inconvenience: Or if he lie only under ≈øu≈øpicion and doubt, his Tryal would be defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; or if he be fal≈øly accu≈øed and charged, he is delayed from clearing and vindicating his own innocence in the mean while, which is a very great prejudice &amp; trouble to him≈øelf.</p>
            <p>But here by a ≈øtrange Art and mo≈øt wicked Corruption, of <hi>calling evil good, and good evil;</hi> of <hi>ju≈øtifying the wicked for reward, and taking away the righteou≈øne≈øs of the righteous from him,</hi> I≈øa. 5. 20. 23. by <hi>turning of things up≈øide down,</hi> I≈øa. 29. 16. the afore≈øaid <hi>Richard Stafford</hi> is charged to do a thing <hi>unlawfully, unju≈øtly,</hi> and <hi>wickedly,</hi> when he doth only lay the Laws of God before Men; He doth endeavour (according to his Duty and the Grace committed unto him) to turn them from Iniquity unto Righteou≈øne≈øs. He doth ≈øay and affirm, That all the Words mentioned in the afore≈øaid Papers are True, Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficative, and will be certainly fulfilled. He doth come in the <hi>Name of Almighty God,</hi> and will make evident his Commi≈ø≈øion, that he is really ≈øent, and hath more words to ≈øpeak out in Per≈øon <hi>viva voce,</hi> unto the Honourable Hou≈øes of Parliament; Hoping that they will not be like their Forefathers, a Rebellious and Stubborn Generation, which refu≈øe to hear the Law of their God. It is Gods con≈øtant Method to ≈øpeak unto the World by tho≈øe of the ≈øame likene≈øs with our ≈øelves; and he doth commonly rai≈øe up mean Per≈øons to convey forth his Truth unto Men, That the excellency ≈øhould be of God, and not of us. I dare not abu≈øe nor trifle with his <hi>Name,</hi> but am ready to explain the nature and meaning thereof, if I may be heard out throughly without any interruption. And ≈øo likewi≈øe, ye ought to take heed how ye reject it, for you will admit of things of le≈ø≈øer moment. If another ≈øhould come from an Earthly Prince, or di≈øcover ≈øome new thing, or in a matter of Peace and War, of Rights or Priviledges, him will ye hear: But ye are apt to refu≈øe or di≈øregard, what hath relation to the immediate Government of him who is the <hi>Great King over all the Earth,</hi> and in ≈øubordination to that, is not only for the real Peace and Security of this whole Nation, but of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms round about. If I ≈øpeak fal≈øhood or folly, as I ≈øhould then be liable unto the Wrath and Judgment of the great God for taking his Name in vain, and making vile his Maje≈øty; ≈øo in the mean while, I contentedly ≈øubmit to be made an Example of your utmo≈øt Severity and Puni≈øhment, for di≈øturbing and interrupting your Coun≈øels. But if I ≈øpeak Wi≈ødom and Truth, I ought to be hearkened unto.</p>
